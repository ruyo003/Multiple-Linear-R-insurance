# Insurance Dataset Analysis and Expense Prediction


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs analysis on an insurance dataset to determine the relationship between the features and expenses. It then utilizes multiple linear regression to predict future expenses based on the identified relationships.

Dataset Overview:

The insurance dataset contains information about individuals, including age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoker status, region, and insurance expenses.
The goal of the analysis is to understand how these features relate to insurance expenses and to predict future expenses for new individuals.

Analysis Highlights:

Explores the relationships between features and insurance expenses.
Visualizes correlations and distributions of variables using graphs and charts.
Identifies key factors influencing insurance expenses through statistical analysis.

Prediction Model:

Utilizes Multiple Linear Regression to predict future insurance expenses based on the identified features.
Trains the regression model on a subset of the dataset and evaluates its performance.
Generates predictions for new individuals using the trained model.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn,)

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook (insurance_analysis.ipynb) and execute the cells to run the analysis and prediction.

Feel free to explore the analysis results, modify the notebook, or extend the analysis as needed! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
